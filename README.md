# FriendFinder

A simple matchmaking site hosted on Heroku (https://agile-eyrie-96248.herokuapp.com/) which takes in some questions from the user and matches them with another person of similar personality stored in a server-side array. Each user also gets pushed into the array after submitting the form and being matched.
